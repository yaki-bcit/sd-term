  make sure functions from IOhandler are piped appropriately

in ioHandler.js:
  write function called "unzip" which takes a finlename as an argument and uses pipe:
    * write code as promise
    * console.log message "Extraction operation complete" when the promise issues 'accept'

  write a function called "readDir" which takes a subdirectory as an argument:
    * read file names into an array, making sure to ignore anything but PNG's
    * return the array

  write a function called "grayScaleAlg" which takes pixel data to implement the grayscale algorithm:
    * write it with a promise
    * carry out the algorithm pixel by pixel
    * stream OR return transformed data

  write a function called "grayScale" which takes pathIn and PathOut as arguments and uses pipe:
    * create a stream from PNGJS to stream file contents (OR return an array of pixels)
    * stream OR pass the pixel data to grayScaleAlg
    * write out the transformed pixels to pathOut directory
